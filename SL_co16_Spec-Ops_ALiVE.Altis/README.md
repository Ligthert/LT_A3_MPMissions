# (co16) Spec-Ops v0.8 by Sacha Ligthert
###############################

Dynamic Spec-Ops-esque Missions on Altis for smaller groups.

Taking an example from Patrol Ops I thought it would be nice to setup a scenario more geared towards specops related activities. This is my first attempt!

## Features
* Small dynamic spec-ops scenarios in random locations;
* Meant to be played by 4 players;
* A living and breathing world thanks to ALiVE;
* Simple but harsh little missions that require patience and time to complete.

## Required mods
* CBA - http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=18767
* ALiVE - http://alivemod.com/

## Recommendations
* Play with TFR or ACRE2 for an authentic experience
* Select one scenario at the time
* After you've completed several scenarios, in the ALiVE admin menu profile non-profiled units to lighten the load on the server
* Take your time searching the objective and carefully plan your assault

## Todo
* A nasty QRF
* Data extraction scenarios
* Covert ops scenarios
* Redo the compositions
* Sanitize sniper missions


## Known issues
* None so far. Pleas report them.

## Credits
* Spliffz for showing me how to use locations
* ALiVE dev-team and closed testers for their support
